In this project i tried to build a blog app using go as backend language and html, css, javascript as frontend and mysql as database.
The aim of the project is beside go and basic frontend, is to learn websockets and practice the usage of websockets.
I used websockets to instant communication. When any user likes a blog the owner of blog gets notification and the like count of blog changes immediately.
Users can create blogs with image and publish them. Also users can add profile picture for themselves.
Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt library.
I used go-gin and gorilla websocket and dgrijalva/jwt
